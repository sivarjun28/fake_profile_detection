# FAKE ACCOUNTS DETECTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING

The rapid growth of OSNs and the massive amount of personal data of its subscribers
have attracted attackers, and imposters to steal personal data, share false news, and spread malicious
activities. In this project, four machine learning classification algorithms were used to decide the target
accountâ€™s identity real or fake. Those algorithms were Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
and CNN.
